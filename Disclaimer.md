# Disclaimer

This project is provided for **educational, research, and demonstration purposes only**.

The SOC Engine is **not a production security product** and should not be relied upon
as the sole mechanism for incident detection, response, or containment in live environments.

## 1. No Production Warranty

This software is provided **“as is”**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied,
including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, or non-infringement.

The author makes **no guarantees** regarding:
- Accuracy of detections
- Completeness of analysis
- Timeliness of response
- Suitability for regulatory or compliance use

## 2. Advisory-Only Decision Making

All outputs generated by this system are **advisory in nature**.

- Risk scores are heuristic-based
- MITRE mappings are probabilistic
- Policy outcomes reflect sample organizational rules

**Final response decisions must always be made by qualified security personnel.**

## 3. AI & Tooling Usage Disclosure

This project was developed using a combination of:
- Traditional software engineering practices
- Security domain knowledge
- **AI-assisted tooling**, including (but not limited to):
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT- and Gemini-based systems
  - Other AI platforms used for reasoning, validation, and design iteration

AI tools were used to:
- Assist with architecture exploration
- Refine logic and structure
- Validate assumptions and edge cases
- Improve documentation clarity

**All final logic, control flow, and design decisions were reviewed, validated,
and intentionally implemented by the author.**

AI tools did **not** operate autonomously and did **not** make unchecked decisions
within the system.

## 4. AI Advisory Layer Disclaimer

When enabled, the AI advisory layer:
- Does **not** perform autonomous actions
- Does **not** override deterministic logic
- Produces **non-authoritative** narrative insights

AI-generated output may contain inaccuracies or incomplete interpretations and must be
reviewed by a human analyst before any action is taken.

AI functionality can be fully disabled via environment configuration.

## 5. No Malicious Use

This project must **not** be used for:
- Unauthorized access
- Circumventing security controls
- Offensive cyber operations
- Surveillance or monitoring without consent

Any misuse of this software is solely the responsibility of the user.
